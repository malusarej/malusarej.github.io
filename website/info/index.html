                            As a game dev intern, I helped improve existing gameplay mechanics, increasing player
                            retention by 63% and created two new story time events using Vue.js framework for the
                            first time, learning an innovative technology on the job and reducing player churn by
                            48%. I received positive feedback for my contributions to the game and learned how to
                            effectively take directions and execute deliverables. At Ratibpal, I worked on an app that
                            focused on delivering farm-to-table sourced milk to local households across the city of
                            Pune, contributing to the development of new features such as improved tracking
                            systems for milk delivery. My experience working at a startup fueled my passion for
                            problem-solving and customer satisfaction.
