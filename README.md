**What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?**
- Figuring out good color schemes and backgrounds and how to make it visually pleasing.
- It was easy to work with HTML and I had to use a lot of concepts from previous assignments for CSS.
- This assignment took me around 7-8 hours.

**What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?**
- I made the content responsive so it's not harder to read while making the screen smaller.
- I had the navbar change from a vertical column to a horizontal view
- I had elements stack on top of each other for easy reading.

**What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?**
- The backgrounds should match more natural features such as wood, paper etc to contrast the technical website and content.
- I'm a little proud of scrollable entries for the blog and the grid system for the dates and the text.
- Also, took into account color contrasts and highlights such as maroon for navbar because it worked across all backgrounds.

**Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?**
- More animations using CSS such as having the navbar be dynamic
- Add more images to improve the layout and add logos that would be dynamic as well.
- More clean and profession styling such as using more professional fonts and adding boxes highlighting content from links being clicked.

**How many hours did you spend on this assignment?**
- I spent around seven to eight hours doing this assignment.
- A lot of time was spent researching components I wanted especially on w3schools and stackoverflow
- Spent some time conceptualizing the design as well

**(Optional) If you made any assumptions about this assignment, what are they**
- TAs will replace the image locations with paths relative to their machines.
